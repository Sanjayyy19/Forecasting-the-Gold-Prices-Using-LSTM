# Forecasting-the-Gold-Prices-Using-LSTM
This project focuses on forecasting future gold prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Since gold price data is time-series and depends on historical trends, LSTM was chosen because it is effective at learning long-term patterns in sequential data.
Historical gold price data was collected and preprocessed by handling missing values and normalizing the prices. The data was then converted into sequences, where past prices were used to predict future prices. An LSTM-based deep learning model was built and trained using this processed data.
after training, the model was used to predict gold prices on unseen data. The predicted prices closely followed the actual price trends, showing that LSTM can effectively capture fluctuations in gold prices. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques in financial time-series forecasting.
